Watch a full video to learn to upload large files in Github. Basically, Github has provided features to upload files size that must be less than 25 MB. All the time, it is not possible to complete the project within 25 MB. This feature in which a user can upload limited file sized may often cause trouble while you are trying to upload your own project files. That is why I have presented you with this tutorial video to solve the issue of uploading large files. With this technique, you can easily upload any file sized projects into Github.
